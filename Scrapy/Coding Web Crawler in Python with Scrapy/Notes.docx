scrapy startproject neuralcrawling
(it will create a project named neuralcrawling)


Inside neuralcrawling folder, there will be another folder with the same name neuralcrawling and a scrapy.cfg file


Inside neuralcrawling (subfolder)
we have a folder named spiders, and few python files (__init__.py, items.py, middlewares.py, pipelines.py, settings.py)


Inside spiders (subfolder)
we have only one file __init__.py 



create a new file inside spiders folder, crawling_spider.py (manually)



>> To run

cd neuralcrawling (the main project, not the subfolder with the same name)
scrapy crawl mycrawler


if you want to save the result in json file

scrapy crawl mycrawler -o output.json
